# Introduction
This folder contains updated files for the "Django Djitney" project on Codecademy. The goal of this project is to practice creating views and mapping them to URL paths.

For this project, the models and templates were already provided, so I've only included files that were written by me, with the exclusion of `/templates/base.html`, which is provided for context/reference.
