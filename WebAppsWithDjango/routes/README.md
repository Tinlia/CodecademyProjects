# Introduction
This folder contains updated files for the "Django Djitney" project on Codecademy. The goal of this project is to pratice creating views and mapping urls to them.
For this project, the models and templates were already provided, so I've only included files that were written by me, with the exclusion of `/templates/base.html` which
is provided for context/reference.
